Project Structure:-
    manifest.json --> used for when opened in mobile phone



React creates it own virtual dom
which is ReactDom --> which has a function createRoot

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

it provide the functionality of creating our own tags ex <App/>

without React.StrictMode we can render our app 

we never included the script file in the index.html then how the index.js file can take the document.getElementById property ?

--> react-scripts in the package.json this adds automatically <script defer="" src="/static/js/bundle.js"></script>


but Vite don't use the react-scripts then how it connects the js 
--> it directly loaded in the index.html

vite is light weight as it does not load many js libraries


.. Since vite is a strict in it's syntax we can't we want to create a component we must give the extension as .jsx otherwise it can't be rendered and must use the uppercase for the first name


return statement can only send one element that's why we use <></>


.. the normal react without vite making a component always use capitalize function names other wise in normal also we cant use small letters

.. best practice for keeping file name is in capitalize format




// creating own react
 -> react tries to make a tree of the tags

// injecting variables in jsx
